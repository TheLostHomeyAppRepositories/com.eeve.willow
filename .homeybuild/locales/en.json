Then, go to the Settings widget and select Remote Control. This will open a web browser where you can view the URL containing the robot's IP address, typically in the format http://192.168.x.x:8080. Copy the IP address (excluding the port :8080) and enter it in the next view in the app to proceed with the remote control setup.",
